This is some additional information for the article "Data science and environmental sustainability: mastering the information and knowledge"

The purpose of this work is to analyze the properties of the data ecosystem and highlight the key aspects of methodology for data science with respect to environmental sustainability. The results of the study are illustrated by the case study on the optimal taxi dispatching.

## On-Taxi-Demand - project description
### Goal: Create the predictive models on taxi demand in New York:
1. import, cleaning, and exploration of the taxi data of "SUPER TAXIS";
2. aggregation of pick-ups and drop-offs into six regions;
3. summary table of pick-ups and drop-offs totals by region and hour;
4. initial analysis of summary table, structural selection of the predictive models (definition of independent
variables);
5. data partitioning (datasets for training and testing);
6. models training and validation;
7. testing and evaluation of the selected models;
8. results discussion and recommendations.
